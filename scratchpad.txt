D'Accord Idea Scratch Pad
==========================

Authentication:
=================
Standard local email/password based accounts
OpenID http://openid.net/ (provider and consumer for user accounts)
OAuth 2.0 http://oauth.net/ (for API access and app authorization)

Data Exchange
=================
FOAF/FOAF-JSON http://www.foaf-project.org/ (for sharing friend information)
JSON http://www.json.org/ (primary data exchange format)

Communication and Platform Features
====================================
A "wall" with status updates, sharing, comments and other feedback methods ("likes" or up/down vote)
XMPP http://xmpp.org/ (for live text chat)
Photo/Video/Audio Gallery
Google+ style "circles"
Private Messaging system
User Profiles, Pages and Groups
The ability to subscribe to a page or user 


Unique feature: Public, themeable blogs
=========================================
Users can chose to enable a number of blogs (a site admin can chose if there is a limited number per user or no limit).
The user can set certain posts to go to the blog(s) and keep others private or restricted to logged in users.
This allows a user to manage multiple blogs and their personal profile from one interface.
They can make the blog their public (as in the whole internet can see it) face
while keeping things that they only want to share among friends or limited circles from prying eyes.

Fairly novel feature: Cross-site friends and communication
=====================================================
While a user can create more than one D'Accord profile on more than one D'Accord installation, they will not have to so to interact with user on another D'Accord installation.
One account on a single site can be used automatically (through the magic of the API and OAuth) on different sites.
This means a user can add accounts from other D'Accord sites to their friends list and friend and chat/comment/like/share with friends and users on other D'Accord sites.

API and Applications
=====================
REST API http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representational_state_transfer
D'Accord installations will communicate with each other via a REST API
Mobile and desktop applications and third party sites will interact with D'Accord installs via a REST API
OpenSocial http://docs.opensocial.org/display/OS/Home (application standard)
"Login with D'Accord" feature that can be used on third party sites for authentication (could use either OAuth or OpenId for this).

Look and Feel -- Asthetics and Standards
=================

responsive web design http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Responsive_Web_Design


Other Notes
============

* Emphasis on privacy and data security, with fine grained privacy and sharing controls for the user.

* Databases supported: MySQL and SQLite (MongoDB?) -- more can be added later.

* Develop an API and application standard and produce three official implementations in Java, Python and PHP Zend framework.

* Support for having virtual MySpace and Facebook friends in your friends list. Support for relatively seamless interaction with your Facebook and MySpace friends.

* Support for users to import their Facebook, MySpace or other profile into their D'Accord account
